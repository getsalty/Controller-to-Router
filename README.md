# Controller-to-Router

C#, Entity Framework, Controller - converted to - TypeScript, Prisma, TRPC Router


Runs using Deno.

Install Deno and then run the "dev" script.


Make sure you have a Asp.NET Controller that uses Entity Framework.  Put that file path in 'main.ts' and see what this conversion turns out.  This won't be a 100% conversion, but it will help a lot.
